<h1>Music History</h1>
       The oldest examples of written music come from ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, with tablets from around 1400 BCE containing instructions for musical performance, rather than a complete score.
    
       <ln>Later, in ancient Greece, a symbolic system of notation was developed, leading to the first complete composition</ln>
