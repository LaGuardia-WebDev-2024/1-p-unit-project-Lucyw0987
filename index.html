<h1>Music History</h1>
       The oldest examples of written music come from ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, with tablets from around 1400 BCE containing instructions for musical performance, rather than a complete score.
    
       <ln>Later, in ancient Greece, a symbolic system of notation was developed, leading to the first complete composition</ln>
    <h1>The First Instruments Include</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>ancient flute</li>
        <li>Lithophones</li>
        <li>Drums</li>
        <li>Chordophones</li>
<br>
<br>
       Philosophers like <em>Pythagoras</em> and <em>Plato</em> explored music's mathematical and psychological aspects in ancient Greece.
